# SnapText
This is a OCR -Tool for screenshots made with OpenCV, Python and Pillow, which is ment to recognize text in images for use with Application, Websites and Images where you are unable to copy the text by selecting it.

## Disclaimer
This is still WIP.

## Known Issues
- With multiple Screens/Monitors connected, it will only capture the "main" screen
- Launching the code will trigger the screenshot immediately without giving the chance to switch between Apps
- the text in the ROI has to be big enough to undergo OCR => Necessary to zoom in manually
